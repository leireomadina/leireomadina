# Hi! My name is Leire ðŸ¤˜

### About me

Iâ€™m a junior front end developer, passionate about both the **creation** process and the **strategy**, **organization** and **planning** that it entails. And Iâ€™ve discovered programming as my true vocation, a puzzle where my two halves fit together: the **logic** and the **creative** one.

Thanks to my knowledge and past experiences in different sectors and **interdisciplinary** environments such as **architecture**, **research** and **design**, I am a **versatile** and **analytical** person with **critical thinking** and attention to **detail**.

Due to my **curiosity** and love for **technology**, Iâ€™m **self-taught** in design, web layout and programming. After finishing the **Adalab** bootcamp, Iâ€™m ready and super motivated to undertake a new adventure in this sector.
